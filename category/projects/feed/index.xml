<p>My father has a great and many talents, the best of which is carpentry. He has built garages, houses, and tables. Using YouTube, I found many peoples videos of how they made their own arcade systems at home and decided it would be a fun project when I had some downtime. </p>

<p>During the winter in 2014, with my fathers guidance and some blueprints I found online, we went to work measuring, cutting, and screwing everything together for a arcade system with series of draws in the back and shelves for more commonly used items.</p>

<p>After the frame was done, I started on the part that most appealed to me, the computer. I used a Raspberry Pi model 3+ to power the system along with a TV screen, an audio controller that powers 2 speakers near the marquee, and a set of arcade buttons and joystick for each player. It is designed for 2 players but I&#8217;m thinking of a way to attached a temporary set of arcade buttons and joysticks to the sides the cabinet and make it a temporary 4 player set up too.</p>

<p>In the year of 2017, I decided to build my first computer. I started doing research online about the steps to build them from the ground up starting with the motherboard, CPU, RAM, GPU, etc. I thought the task of finding the parts was going to be a challenge for me but I discovered a website called TigerDirect that sold bare bone kits that simplified the process. It was a mid-level kit at the time and I found many ways to make improvements to it. I included a CD drive, Blu-ray Drive, 4 TB of storage, and upgraded the GPU  once I realized that the one that came in the kit was a few years old and did not support many high end video games.</p>
